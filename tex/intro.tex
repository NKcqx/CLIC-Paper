\section{Introduction}

Recent progresses in big data and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced and energized data analytics.  With diverse goals for performance, scalability, and programming efficiency, data processing platforms targeting different domains are emerging and being actively developed. For instance, tasks such as data cleaning, filtering and aggregation are generally
performed on a DBMS or big data platforms like Spark~\cite{}; graph algorithms such as relationship discovery are performed on GraphX or Giraph~\cite{}; deep learning models are trained on platforms like Tensorflow~\cite{} and Pytorch~\cite{}, to name a few.
According to their unique properties and suited data types, a modern data analytics workflow is usually built as a sequence of tasks that are executed on different platforms~\cite{}. 

Since platforms may have fundamentally different programming
models, building a cross-platform workflow while achieving 
high performance not only demands expertise for all platforms, but also needs to develop ad-hoc programs to orchestrate them. 
This gives rise to a spectrum of frameworks that facilitate the development of cross-platform workflows and help relieve the deployment overhead []. 
These frameworks support platforms from multiple domains as the back-ends. Users have a transparent view of the underlying platforms and are provided with an intermediate representation to express workflows. 
By considering workload and platform efficiency, the framework selects platforms for each task in the workflow to optimize the overall performance with a cost model and then deploys the workflow for execution.

In recent years, data scientists have been migrating data analytics tasks to the cloud. The data set can be very large in current tasks, cloud provides conceptually unlimited resources that can fit very large scale computing tasks without purchasing and maintaining by each user. Second, maintaining software environment, e.g., dependencies and platform versions, across a cluster is time-consuming and a misconfigured environment can impact the overall performance[]. Cloud is able to effectively manage the environment with virtualization techniques such as container. Last but not the least, cloud supports scaling on demand, which avoids resource underutilization with less intensive workloads. However, existing cross-platform frameworks are not designed for the cloud.

To efficiently run tasks on the cloud, a cross-platform data analytics framework should equip the following features. \textit{1) Robust platform selection} Properly selecting platforms for a workflow is the key to improve its performance. The cluster in the cloud contains servers with different hardware configurations, key differences such as the existence of GPUs could influence the platform selection. For instance, Tensorflow may be chosen for performing a machine learning task for nodes with GPUs, while MPI works better for CPU-only nodes.  Since users may purchase different nodes for executing their workflows, the platform selection mechanism should consider the hardware configuration to make the right choice. However, current approaches assume fixed hardware environment and lack the consideration of hardware in platform selection.  
\textit{2) Agile Platform Integration} Data processing platforms are constantly being developed and updated. While a framework needs to integrate these platforms in time to support new functionalities or higher performance, it makes integrating new platforms with low overhead a desired feature. In current cross-platform systems, integrating a new platform changes the source code of the framework, leading to rebuild, test, and deploy the entire system. Moreover, the model used for platform selection needs to be retrained. All of the involved overhead is nontrivial. \textit{3) Cloud-Native Architecture} To execute data analysis tasks on the cloud, they would distributedly run in containers or VMs, and tasks of different platforms in a workflow should be decoupled for they may run on nodes with different hardware.
Moreover, the framework itself should be implemented as a cloud-native application to utilize the fault tolerance and orchestration. These requirements strongly demand a redesign of a cross-platform framework for the cloud.



To address the above issues, We propose CLIC, a cloud-native cross-platform computing framework that is designed for effectively and efficiently performing data analytics workflows on the cloud.
To cope with the key factors that influence platform selection, i.e., diverse hardware and new platform integration, we adopt a specifically designed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model for selecting platforms. By constructing the workflow as a graph, GCN can be efficient with considering the adjacent tasks in the workflow. [TODO:xxxxx]
CLIC is designed as a cloud-native architecture, where tasks of supported platforms can be directly deployed on cloud and the functional units are decoupled as microservices. In this way, cloud features including liveness detection and self-healing can be utilized to make CLIC a rubost framework for developing and deploying data analytics workflows.
