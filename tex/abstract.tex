With the ever-increasing data volume and business logic complexity, a modern data science application is generally built as a workflow consisting of multiple tasks, which are deployed on different data processing platforms for either specific functionalities or higher performance. With the high scalability and availability, cloud computing is promising for building such data science applications. However, existing cross-platform frameworks are not designed for cloud and cannot exploit its advantages.

This paper proposes CLIC, a cloud-native framework for cross-platform data science applications. By deploying workflows with a cloud-native architecture and assigning tasks to the most appropriate computing platforms via a deep learning model, CLIC can enhance the performance of modern data science applications while reducing the development and deployment efforts. Moreover, CLIC also demonstrates high extensibility in coping with various scenarios by easily integrating new platforms of different programming languages and paradigms.
