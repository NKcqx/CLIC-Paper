\section{Conclusion}
We have made a strong case by designing and implementing CLIC to serve as a cloud-native framework for cross-platform workflows. Optimized for data science applications, CLIC supports agile platform integration, environment management, and flexible scaling. Experimental results on multiple platforms and applications show that CLIC is capable of selecting appropriate platforms for a workflow and enhancing its overall performance. Overall, CLIC demonstrates a promising solution for adopting cross-platform computing in building data science applications.
